# freeCodeCamp

freeCodeCamp is a friendly community where you can learn to code for free. It is run by a donor-supported 501(c)(3) nonprofit with the goal of helping millions of busy adults transition into tech. Our community has already helped more than 10,000 people get their first developer job.

Here are some projects I've created.
